## Scenario 2. Single-Tenant with a Single-Node Graph via the Northbound APIThe purpose of this scenario is to use a preconfigured Python script to create one tenant with one single-node graph within the APIC.> NOTE: If you have already created objects in the APIC, you must [remove those objects](../Scenario4) before running this scenario.

![Figure1](images/Figure1.png)

> NOTE: The Python script method calls individual XML scripts to create a series of objects. To pause the script and create an object using an APIC wizard, see the instructions inline. Objects that can be created via wizard using this script are indicated with (*) in the list below.

The Python script performs the following functions:

* Creates a Tenant* Imports Citrix Device Package* Creates L4-L7 Device Cluster** Create Concrete Device* Create Logical Interfaces* Connect Interfaces of Logical to Concrete Device* Creates the Application Profile* Creates the Security Contract* Creates the Service Graph* Attaches Service Graph to Contract*
Use the User Interfaces of Cisco APIC and NetScaler VPX to confirm deployed settings:
* View VLAN’s in APIC* View Load Balancing Virtual Server and VLAN’s in NetScaler VPX* View Port Group mappings for VPX* Verify MAC addresses for VPX in VMware vCenter* Verify deployed L4-L7 parameters in NetScaler VPX

Method  | Automation Level | Explanation   | Completion Time | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------   |------------- 
Use Python Scripting to Build Objects Within the APIC  | High |  To configure the APIC objects with scripts, the user downloads a set of configuration scripts and employs them in a command window, monitoring the output via the APIC UI.| 20 minutes      | To maximize the effectiveness of this Scenario, view the relevant directories in APIC while the Python scripts are working, to show the discovery of the network objects in real-time.
Manual Configuration of Individual Objects  | Low  | Use an APIC wizard and the configuration parameters provided in this script to manually create each required object| 60 minutes      | See the links in each step to the procedure for manual object creation.

### Steps 

1. From the demonstration workstation, go to the open **Application Policy Infrastructure Controller** window.
2. If the application is not open, launch **Application Policy Infrastructure Controller** by clicking the **APIC Login** icon.
	 a. Log in with the following credentials: Username: admin, Password: **C1sco12345**.3. Click **VM Networking** from the top menu.4. Expand the **VMware** folder and show that there is no VMware present.5. Click the PuTTY shortcut to open the application, then double-click Tools to load the stored session.
 ![Figure2](images/Figure2.png)
6. Login to PuTTy (**user01/user01**) and place it so that both the PuTTY window and the APIC directories are visible.
 ![Figure3](images/Figure3.png)
7. From the command line type **./request.py Citrix_Scripts/Build_Citrix_VPX.cfg** and hit **<Enter>**. 
> NOTE: To show the XML code as the Python script calls each XML script, substitute**./xml_request.py Citrix_Scripts/Build_Citrix_VPX.cfg** for the above command.
 ![Figure4](images/Figure4.png)
> This is an example of the partial XML output for the **Build_Citrix_VPX.xml** script. 

	The Build_Citrix_VPX.cfg script utilizes a series of XML scripts to perform the necessary configuration steps. It will pause between each of the XML scripts, and the user can either press <Enter> to run the script, or type s to skip the scriptand configure the object via a wizard. While the script is running, a brief description will display what that script is doing, while the APIC window updates in real-time. When a script completes successfully, the success code 200 will appear onscreen.

>The following step creates the tenant in APIC. To perform this procedure manually, type s and hit enter at the prompts for the 1N_Tenant.xml script.

8. Create the **Tenant**.

 	a. In the APIC top menu, select **Tenants**. Select **ALL TENANTS** from the top sub-menu.

 		c. The **Visa** tenant is created and displayed in the top menu. If necessary, click **Refresh**   to display it in the tenant list. (If a **Server Side Error** message is generated, wait a few seconds before refreshing again.)
	![Figure7](images/Figure7.png)

	d. Double-click the newly created **Visa** tenant.	e. Expand the **Tenant Visa > Networking > Bridge Domains** directory to show that the **VisaBDApp** and **VisaBDWeb**bridge domains have been created.	f.
