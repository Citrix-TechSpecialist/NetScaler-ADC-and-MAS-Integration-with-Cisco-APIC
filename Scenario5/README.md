## Scenario 5. Building a Single Tenant with a Single-Node Graph within the APIC using Service Manager mode via the Northbound API

The purpose of this scenario is to separate the L2-L3 and L4-L7 policy configuration by using a preconfigured Python script to create **one tenant** with **one single-node graph** within the APIC, and then use Citrix NetScaler MAS to configure the application policy.

 > **NOTE**: If you have already run a scenario that created objects in the APIC, you must [remove those objects](../Scenario4) before running this scenario.

 ![Screenshot1](images/Screenshot1.png)

 > **NOTE**: The Python script method calls individual XML scripts to create a series of objects. To pause the script and create an object using an APIC wizard, see the instructions inline. Objects that can be created via wizard using this script are indicated with (*) in the list below.


The Python script performs the following functions:

* Create a Tenant
* Import Citrix Device Package
* Create L4-L7 Device Manager
* Create L4-L7 Device Cluster
	* Create Concrete Device
	* Create Logical Interfaces
	* Connect Interfaces of Logical to Concrete Device
* Create the Application Profile
* Create the Security Contract
* Create the Service Graph
* Attach Service Graph to Contract

Use the User Interfaces of Cisco APIC, NetScaler VPX, and NetScaler MAS to confirm deployed settings:

* View VLAN’s in APIC
* View Load Balancing Virtual Server and VLAN’s in NetScaler VPX
* View Port Group mappings for VPX
* Verify MAC addresses for VPX in VMware vCenter
* Deploy L4-L7 WebGraph parameters in NetScaler MAS
* Verify deployed L4-L7 parameters in NetScaler MAS and in NetScaler VPX

### Steps
1. From the demonstration workstation, go to the open **Application Policy Infrastructure Controller** window.

2. If the application is not open, launch **Application Policy Infrastructure Controller** by clicking the **APIC Login** icon.

	a. Log in with the following credentials: Username: **admin**, Password: **C1sco12345**.

3. Click **Tenants** in the top menu to show that there are no user-created tenants present.

4. Click the PuTTY shortcut to open the application, then double-click Tools to load the stored session.

5. Login to PuTTy (**user01**/**user01**) and place it so that both the PuTTY window and the APIC directories are visible.

  ![Screenshot4](images/Screenshot4.png)
  
6. From the command line type .**/request.py Citrix_Scripts/Build_Citrix_VPX_MAS.cfg** and hit <**Enter**>.

 >**NOTE**: To show the XML code as the Python script calls each XML script, substitute ./xml_request.py Citrix_Scripts/Build_Citrix_VPX_MAS.cfg for the above command.
 >   ![Screenshot5](images/Screenshot5.png)
 >This is an example of the partial XML output for the Build_Citrix_VPX_MAS.xml script.

 The Build_Citrix_VPX_MAS.cfg script utilizes a series of XML scripts to perform the necessary configuration steps. It will pause between each of the XML scripts, and the user can either press <Enter> to run the script, or type s to skip the script and configure the object via a wizard. While the script is running, a brief description will display what that script is doing, while the APIC window updates in real-time. When a script completes successfully, the success code 200 will appear onscreen.
